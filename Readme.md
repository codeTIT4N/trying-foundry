# trying-foundry

Just trying out foundry.

Referring to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de_fomBbLmM

## Notes:
- It is extremely fast.
- Tests are written in solidity, and can be run using `forge test`. To run a specific test file: `forge test --match-contract <Contract Name>`
- Test files will end in `.t.sol` and are present inside the `test` folder.
- Test cases natively support fuzzing and we don't have to pass fuzzing inputs, they are auto generated.
- Logging can be done using `emit log()`.
- By default logs are not visible so to make them visible run `forge test -vv`
- Script files are also written in solidity and they broadcast solidity files to the EVM using `vm.broadcast()` method; 
- Script files end in `.s.sol` and are present inside the `script` folder.
- Local blockchain can be run using `anvil`
- Deploying to localhost and calling functions using cast(kind of like hardhat console):
    - Step 1: Run anvil local blockchain using `anvil`
    - Step 2: Set PRIVATE_KEY environment variable using `export PRIVATE_KEY=<Pvt Key From anvil>`
    - Step 3: Run script to deploy on the local blockchain (in a different terminal instance):
        ```bash
        forge script script/Greetings.s.sol:GreetingsScript --fork-url http://localhost:8545 \ --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
        ```
    - Step 4: Store contract address in another environment variable using `export CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<Contract address from anvil>`
    - Step 5: Call `greet()` using cast: `cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "greet()(string)"`
    - Step 6: Performing transactions using cast: `cast send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "updateGreeting(string)" "Hey" --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY`
    - Step 7; Read greeting again to check if it changed: Same as Step 5
- Using OpenZeppelin contracts: 
    - Step 1: Commit code up till now.
    - Step 2: Run: `forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts` - It will not install if you have not committed the code up till now before installing. This could be because they are going to add OZ as a git submodule. - In the `lib` folder.
    - Step 3: Configure remappings: To tell local environment where to find OZ code, once we try to import and use it.
        - Run: `forge remappings`. Here you can see foundry making some assumptions for our environment:
            ----- PUT SS HERE -----
        - But we will create custom remappings. For that create a file called `remappings.txt` in the folder and put this in there: `@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/`. NOTE: This looks like remappings wile using solc. Maybe this is what is happening under the hood.
    - Step 4: Create a simple ERC721 contract in the `src` folder. 
    - Step 5: Now, you can use OZ as you would in any hardhat project.


Thanks!
